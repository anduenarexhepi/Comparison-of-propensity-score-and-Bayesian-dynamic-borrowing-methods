# Comparison-of-propensity-score-and-Bayesian-dynamic-borrowing-methods
Here you can find the code regarding the simulation and application part of the comparison of propensity score and Bayesian dynamic borrowing methods.  

The Manduena_0.1.6.tar.gz file contains the code for the data generation step in the simulation study and the implementation of the three methods explored.
For obtaining the results of the simulation, the Results files were used together with the Parameter matices.R file. This file contains the parameters for the 
different scenarios and you may store the parameter matrices in a folder first and then run the Results files by calling the parameter matrices
(for DBB and PSMAP an HPC environment was used).
The NOBORROWING file gives the result when one wants to only use the current trial for analysis.

For the application part, refer to the Application Schizophrenia.R file.
